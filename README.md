More Places! (Places Together project v2)
------------------------------------------
Code refactor/revisions on my final project for Ironhack Web Development Intensive Bootcamp ([v1 here](https://github.com/buzzlightyear182/Places-Together))


I wanted to start on a new clean slate instead of branching out from previous repo. My aim is to try out different tools and new ways of implementation.


The concept is pretty much the same as the old one ([here](https://github.com/buzzlightyear182/Places-Together)). Since I already know what I want to achieve in this application, then I could have more time to think about improvements. Looking back at my previous code, it was rushed and very dirty. Now I have more free time to work/play on this mini-project.

-----------------

PLANNED CHANGES:

Write cleaner code, less complexity

Do more tests, including integration tests

Improve ActiveRecord Model structure

Use more model associations

Try out new gems/tools that might be more efficient

Better search function

Responsive design
