PLACES TOGETHER v2
====================

Revision on my final project for Ironhack Web Development Intensive Bootcamp ([v1 here](https://github.com/buzzlightyear182/Places-Together))

I wanted to start on a new clean slate instead of branching out from previous repo.

-----------------

PLANNED CHANGES:

Write cleaner code, less complexity

Do more tests, including integration tests

Improve ActiveRecord Model structure

Use more model associations

Try out new gems/tools that might be more efficient

Better search function

Responsive design
